# PolynomialOrdering

Computes on degree vectors precedented orderings of monomials in array of polynomial terms. Visuaizes results as heatmaps of variable by term with degree heat.

Algorithmized for study of efficient Groebner base computation, additionally seen in Syndrome word analysis of error correcting codes.
